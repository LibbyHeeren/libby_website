Welcome to the repo for my personal website, [libbyheeren.com](https://libbyheeren.com/), which was created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed via CI/CD with GitHub and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

My website is based off of Jadey Ryan’s amazing website! I hope you’ll go
visit [Jadey’s website
repo](https://github.com/jadeynryan/jadey_website) and read her blog
post on deploying with Netlify (and CI/CD!). You can also draw
inspiration from all of the amazing projects on https://quarto.club/
