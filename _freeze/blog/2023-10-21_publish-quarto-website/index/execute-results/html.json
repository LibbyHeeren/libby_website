Instead of adding to that pool of content, my first blog post will describe the workflow that I spent hours struggling with: publishing a Quarto website with Netlify, GitHub, and [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html#rendering-for-ci). This workflow automates my site deployment every time I commit to my GitHub repository.\n\nIn this post, I walk through:\n\n-   building a Quarto website as an RStudio project\n-   connecting this project to a GitHub repository\n-   the first manual Netlify deployment with the RStudio terminal\n-   setting up the configuration files for automatic rendering with Netlify bots, and\n-   using Netlify's deploy previews.\n\n# Why Netlify?\n\nThe free starter plan is enough for me.\n\n![](img/netlify-starter.png){width=\"600\"}\n\nA super nifty feature of Netlify is its free [preview branch deployment system](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/) This means I use a `staging` branch, which Netlify's bots automatically deploy from my repo and allow me to preview it on my computer and phone before publishing to my live website!\n\n::: callout-important\nNetlify servers can only render markdown and not execute code. This means all code must be executed locally on our computers. Read this [article](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html#rendering-for-ci) to learn more about rendering Quarto documents and websites with CI. The workflow presented in this post is in the middle of the continuum <!--# insert a graphic of the continuum --> discussed in the article: \"local execution with CI rendering\".\n\nIf you need to execute code with CI, instead of `Step 4. Deploy with Netlify bots`, you'll need to [configure a GitHub Action](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#executing-code) that executes code, renders the site, and publishes to Netlify.\n:::\n\n# Step 1. Create a Quarto website\n\nIn RStudio, go to `File` \\> `New Project` \\> `New Directory` to open the **New Project Wizard**.\n\nLet's begin with a website. If you'd like to add a blog later on, Samantha Csik wrote a great blog post explaining this process [@csik2022].\n\n![](img/rstudio-project-wizard.png){fig-alt=\"New project wizard with box around Quarto Website.\" width=\"500\"}\n\nChoose the name of your directory (which will also be the name of your GitHub repository), check the `Create a git repository` box, then click `Create Project`.\n\n![](img/create-website.png){fig-alt=\"Create Quarto Website dialog box with a field for directory name and a checkbox selected to create a git repository.\" width=\"500\"}\n\nYou should now be in a RStudio project that has `index.qmd` and `_quarto.yml` open and some new things in your `Files pane`:\n\n![](img/rstudio-website.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio with index.qmd and _quarto.yml open and many new folders and files in the files pane.\" width=\"500\"}\n\nYour `Files pane` should be populated with the following:\n\n```         \nâ”œâ”€â”€ _quarto.yml         # Website configuration file\nâ”œâ”€â”€ about.qmd           # Special about template\nâ”œâ”€â”€ index.qmd           # Landing page\nâ”œâ”€â”€ my-website.Rproj    # RStudio project config file\nâ””â”€â”€ styles.css          # CSS file for any custom styling\n```\n\nNotice we also have a `Git pane` with all of these files unstaged and no branches are available. This is because we haven't created a repository on GitHub and connected it with this project yet.\n\n![](img/git-pane.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio Git pane with a box around (no branch).\" width=\"500\"}\n\n# Step 2. Create and connect to GitHub\n\nIf you've never set up a GitHub repository, check out [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) [@bryan2023]. We're following the [`Existing project, GitHub last`](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last) workflow.\n\nThankfully, we can use the `usethis` package so we don't have to touch the terminal! If you haven't used `usethis` yet, you'll need to do the setup described in the [package documentation](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/usethis-setup.html#install-git).\n\nAssuming you have connected and authenticated your GitHub account in RStudio, you can create and connect your project to a repository with just **two** lines of code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_git()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# âœ” Setting active project to '/Users/jadeyryan/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/my-website'\n# âœ” Adding '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store', '.quarto' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 6 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'my-website.Rproj'\n# * 'styles.css'\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Negative\n# 2: Nope\n# 3: Yeah\n# \n# Selection: 3\n# âœ” Adding files\n# âœ” Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_github()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# â„¹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# âœ” Creating GitHub repository 'jadeynryan/my-website'\n# âœ” Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/jadeynryan/my-website.git'\n# âœ” Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# âœ” Opening URL 'https://github.com/jadeynryan/my-website'\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Step 3. Manually deploy from Netlify\n\nFor easier integration with GitHub, sign up for [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) with GitHub.\n\n![](img/netlify-signup.png){fig-alt=\"Netlify signup page with GitHub login.\" width=\"400\"}\n\nOnce you're logged into Netlify with GitHub, in the `Terminal` run:\n\n``` {.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\nquarto publish netlify\n```\n\n![](img/quarto-publish-netlify.png){fig-alt=\"quarto publish netlify command run in the RStudio terminal.\"}\n\nThis command rendered your site locally, uploaded all the static files to Netlify, deployed and published to your new site! The site overview on Netlify should have opened:\n\n![](img/netlify-site-overview.png){fig-alt=\"Site overview on Netlify with boxes around the random subdomain name and the status as a manual deploy.\" width=\"400\"}\n\nNote that Netlify provided a random site name (**`stately-chimera-0c91c7`**) at the `netlify.app` domain. Also, notice that it says `Manual deploys` underneath the site link, meaning it was deployed from the `quarto publish netlify` command in our terminal and not from GitHub.\n\nClick on the link to open your live site!\n\n![](img/live-website.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of live website at stately-chimera-0c91c7.netlify.app.\"}\n\n## Site domain name\n\nThe domain name is just the URL or web address to your site. You have two options to rename your site:\n\n-   **Free**: change the random name provided but keep the `netlify.app` domain.\n-   **Purchase a new domain**: I recommend buying it from Netlify to not deal with the messiness of [DNS](https://ns1.com/products/dedicated-dns) records. Or, buy from a domain provider that doesn't use the NS1 DNS zone, or you'll get the error in the footnote.[^1]\n\n[^1]: I originally bought a domain from Square Space and could not set my Netlify site to that domain due to DNS issues that I don't fully understand. Here's a [support forum thread](https://answers.netlify.com/t/trying-to-move-domain-from-squarespace-to-netlify/11879) on Netlify with the instructions for pointing a custom domain to a Netlify site. I ended up buying another domain directly from Netlify.\n\n    ![](img/netlify-dns-error.png){fig-alt=\"An error when trying to add a custom domain purchased from Squarespace. The error says a DNS zone already exists on NS1.\" width=\"400\"}\n\n    DNS stuff is so confusing. ðŸ«¤\n\n### Free domain name change\n\nFrom the site overview Netlify page, click on `Site configuration`.\n\n![](img/netlify-site-config.png){fig-alt=\"Netlify website site overview with box around site configuration.\" width=\"400\"}\n\nScroll down to `Site information` then click on `Change site name`.\n\n![](img/netlify-site-info.png){fig-alt=\"Site information page on Netlify with button to change site name.\" width=\"400\"}\n\nNow you can update the site name:\n\n![](img/netlify-change-site-name.png){fig-alt=\"Netlify change site name dialog box with new name of my-website24.netlify.app.\" width=\"400\"}\n\n### Buy a domain name\n\nIf you don't want the `netlify.app` domain, you can purchase your own. Instead of `Site configuration`, go to the `Domain management` part of the site then click `Add a domain`.\n\n![](img/netlify-domain-mgmt.png){fig-alt=\"Domain management part of Netlify site with option to add a domain.\" width=\"400\"}\n\nType in whatever custom domain you want: there are a bajillion different extensions. [domain.com](https://www.domain.com/domains/new-domain-extensions) lists them alphabetically and has a frequently asked questions section. If your desired name is available, you can register the domain for the listed price.\n\n![](img/netlify-add-custom-domain.png){fig-alt=\"Add a custom domain to your site page on netlify. It says my-website24.com is available and costs $13.99 for the first year.\" width=\"400\"}\n\n## New `_publish.yml` file\n\nNotice this new file appeared in the project directory when you used the `quarto publish netlify` command:\n\n``` {.yaml filename=\"_publish.yml\"}\n- source: project\n  netlify:\n    - id: b9f73a69-06e7-4de2-9c7b-4f9855b56ba3\n      url: 'https://stately-chimera-0c91c7.netlify.app'\n```\n\nThe next time you manually publish from the terminal, it will ask if you want to publish the update to `https://my-website24.netlify.app`. If you enter `y`, it will update the `url` value in the `_publish.yml` file.\n\n``` {.bash filename=\"Terminal\"}\n(base) MacBook-Pro-4:my-website jadeyryan$ quarto publish netlify\n? Publish update to: â€º https://stately-chimera-0c91c7.netlify.app (Netlify - jadey.nicole.ryan@gmail.com)\nRendering for publish:\n\n[1/2] index.qmd\n[2/2] about.qmd\n\n[âœ“] Preparing to publish site\n[âœ“] Uploading files (complete)\n[âœ“] Deploying published site\n[âœ“] Published site: https://stately-chimera-0c91c7.netlify.app\n\n(base) MacBook-Pro-4:my-website jadeyryan$ quarto publish netlify\n? Publish update to: â€º https://my-website24.netlify.app (Netlify - jadey.nicole.ryan@gmail.com)\nRendering for publish:\n\n[1/2] index.qmd\n[2/2] about.qmd\n\n[âœ“] Preparing to publish site\n[âœ“] Uploading files (complete)\n[âœ“] Deploying published site\n[âœ“] Published site: https://my-website24.netlify.app\n```\n\n# Step 4. Deploy with Netlify bots\n\nNow we need to configure several things so Netlify's bots can publish our site when we push changes to our repo.\n\n-   Add Quarto Netlify plugin files: `netlify.toml` and `package.json`\n-   Freeze executable code by setting `freeze: auto` in `_quarto.yml`.\n-   Add `_site` directory to `.gitignore`\n-   \n-   Link Netlify site to GitHub repo\n\n## Configure Netlify plugin\n\nThe [Quarto Netlify plugin](https://github.com/quarto-dev/netlify-plugin-quarto) renders the entire website on the Netlify build server.\n\n``` {.toml filename=\"netlify.toml\"}\n[[plugins]]\npackage = \"@quarto/netlify-plugin-quarto\"\n```\n\n``` {.json filename=\"package.json\"}\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@quarto/netlify-plugin-quarto\": \"^0.0.5\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## \n\n## Freeze computations\n\nFirst, we need to [freeze](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) computations so that code is only run locally. When you render a `.qmd` that executes code, the results get saved in a `html.json` file within a `_freeze` directory. This means that no code needs to be run on CI services that don't have R installed.\n\nThe `_freeze` directory and all its files must be committed to your repo. Otherwise, the build will fail because Netlify can't run code (see the detailed error in my [comment](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1956#issuecomment-1773958407)).\n\nAdd these two lines to your `_quarto.yml` file:\n\n``` {.yaml filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto\n```\n\nIf you need to execute code within a CI service, see the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) for example GitHub actions.\n\n## Ignore output\n\nWe also need to add the `_site` directory that contains all the rendered website content to our `.gitignore` file. This is recommended in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#ignoring-output-1) to avoid super messy diffs and potential merge conflicts.\n\n``` {.bash filename=\".gitignore\"}\n/_site/\n```\n\n## Link Netlify site to GitHub repo\n\nOn the Netlify site, go to `Site configuration` \\> `Build & deploy` \\> `Continous deployment` \\> `Link repository`.\n\n![](img/netlify-link-repo.png){fig-alt=\"Netlify site on the continuous deployment page with a box around the link repository button.\" width=\"700\"}\n\nChoose `Deploy with GitHub`:\n\n![](img/netlify-connect-git.png){fig-alt=\"Netlify site to connect to Git provider.\" width=\"400\"}\n\nIf you're already logged into GitHub, it should immediately authorize and allow you to select repositories to allow the Netlify app to access. To get this popup screen (`Installed GitHub App - Netlify`), I clicked the `Configure the Netlify app on GitHub` link at the bottom of the Netlify site.\n\n![](img/netlify-select-repos.png){width=\"500\"}\n\nAfter selecting the correct repository, the next screen will have build settings. Enter `_site` in the `Publish directory` field:\n\n![](img/netlify-build-settings.png){width=\"400\"}\n\nOnce you click `Deploy my-website`, it should take you back to your site overview page and it will now say `Deploys from GitHub` instead of `Manual deploys` below the link.\n\n![](img/netlify-deploys-gh.png){width=\"400\"}\n\nScroll down to make sure the deploy published successfully.\n\n<!--# insert screenshot of this -->\n\n## Commit a change to our repo to test workflow\n\nLet's commit to our repo and make sure it is automatically republished!\n\n# Step 5. Try a deploy preview\n",
