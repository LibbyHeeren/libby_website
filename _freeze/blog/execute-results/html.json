It's also a sharing space where I can drop random \"here's one way to do this thing\" type of posts. My mission is to not curate the heck out of everything and to share the reality of what data work looks like for me. This means I'll get things wrong, I'll try things out, and I'll strive for fun over perfection. I'll also probably forget it exists for large periods of time.     \n\nI welcome conversation that is kind, curious, and courteous.  \n\n✨[**SEE THE ELLSWORTH APP HERE**](https://libbyheeren-ellsworth.share.connect.posit.cloud/)✨\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n",
