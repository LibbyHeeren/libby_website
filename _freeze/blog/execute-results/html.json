An \"I want to share this cool thing\" space. A \"lemme show you how one way to do this\" space. My mission is to not curate everything to heck and to share the reality of what data work looks like for me. This means I'll get things wrong, I'll try things out, and I'll strive for fun over perfection. I hope you find some joy in it.  \n\nI welcome conversation that is kind, curious, and courteous.  \n\n---\n\n\n\n",
