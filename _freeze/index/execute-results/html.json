I have a background in natural sciences (BS in Biology, BA in Environmental Studies, and MS in Land Resources & Environmental Sciences). My R programming skills were self/community taught in an effort to improve efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility in data analyses and visualizations.\n\nThe core values I live by are **kindness**, **authenticity**, **sustainability**, and **inclusivity**. I feel particularly fulfilled working in the environmental data science space and meeting so many amazing folks in the R and open-source community.\n\nPersuaded by several folks who had positive reactions to my [cat & code themed t-shirts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jadeynryan_rstats-positconf2023-activity-7108591736444112896-o1SR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) I made for `posit::conf(2023)`, I started a small business! I am excited to tap into my creativity and combine some of my favorite things in designs that embody cats, programming, and data science. `Coming soon`: check out my Etsy shop [**the coding cats**](shop.qmd)!\n\nProfessionally, I am happiest automating tedious tasks and developing data driven decision-support tools. \n\nPersonally, I am happiest hanging out with my husband and three snowshoe siamese cats, trying new foods, and playing in the beautiful outdoors.\n\n![](assets/img/mts.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Three snowshoe siamese cats laying under a Christmas tree.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"}\n",
