The methods and models that get the most airtime rarely represent the reality of day-to-day data work for the majority of people, and that can lead to the average data human feeling pretty inadequate by comparison.  \n\nI found myself wanting to talk candidly with other data professionals and students so that I could develop a healthier, more realistic perspective of my own journey. And once I did that, I thought… why not share that with the world? \n\nTurns out, we all have a lot of struggles, fears, aspirations, and questions in common, we just don’t put it out in the world because that feels vulnerable. So, let’s share our stories.  \n\n\n**Links to individual episodes and show notes will be here soon. Thanks for your patience as I migrate my site from Squarespace to Quarto!** \n",
