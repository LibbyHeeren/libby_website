    "text": "Hi there! \n\nThanks for visiting my website – I’m happy you’re here!\nI started a small business to tap into my creativity and combine two of my favorite things: cats and code. I create designs that embody the general theme of cats, programming, and data science. Check out my shop the coding cats!\nIn my day job, I work as a data scientist for the Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences section within the Washington State Department of Agriculture. I have a background in natural sciences (BS in Biology, BA in Environmental Studies, and MS in Land Resources & Environmental Sciences). My R programming skills were self/community taught in an effort to improve efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility in data analyses and visualizations.\nThe core values I live by are kindness, authenticity, sustainability, and inclusivity. I feel particularly fulfilled working in the environmental data science space and meeting so many amazing folks in the R and open-source community.\nI am happiest when hanging out with my husband and three snowshoe siamese cats, trying new foods, playing in the beautiful outdoors, automating tedious tasks, and developing data driven decision-support tools."
