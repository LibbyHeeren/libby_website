This is a messy, experimental, learning-out-loud space. My mission is to not curate everything to heck and to share the reality of **my** data work. This means I'll get things wrong, I'll try things out, and I'll strive for fun over perfection.

I welcome conversation that is kind, curious, and courteous.

# list names of post folders
posts <- list.dirs(
  path = here::here("blog"),

# extract the slugs
slugs <- gsub("^.*_", "", posts)

# lines to insert to a netlify _redirect file
redirects <- paste0("/blog/", slugs, " ", "/blog/", posts)

# write the _redirect file
