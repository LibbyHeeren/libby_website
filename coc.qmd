title: Code of Conduct
---

I value content and feedback that is true, helpful, inspiring, necessary, and kind.  This means I will:

-   be friendly, courteous, and respectful
-   take great care to not make statements that could cause offence, personal hurt, or discourage participation/conversation

I am putting putting myself in a vulnerable position by posting content to the internet. I hope others, no matter their level of experience, field of study, area of work, or industry, feel comfortable enough to participate in discussions in the spirit of learning out loud.

I will not post unacceptable content, and I will delete any references or comments that contain it.

I define unacceptable content as anything included or linked to that:  

- is being used to abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others
- is libelous, knowingly false, ad-hominem, or misrepresents another person
- infringes upon a copyright or trademark
- violates an obligation of confidentiality
- violates the privacy of others

I define and determine what is “unacceptable content” on a case-by-case basis, and my definitions are not limited to this list. I reserve the right to change these standards at any time with no notice.
