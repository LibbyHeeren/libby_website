## Hello, Data Humans!

I'm on a mission to speak candidly about the day-to-day work of data professionals. I love applied statistics, machine learning, and useful visualizations. I'm also an R educator and data community builder who wants you to know you belong in the R community. I'm so glad you're here!

In my free time, you can find me hanging out with my husband and our cats, or doing one of the following:

-   reading non-fiction, fantasy, mystery, and sci-fi ([have you seen my DS Hangout recommendations?!](https://www.notion.so/datahumans/2f4552fd18be4d439b6b6977077e6ca5?v=738d0654fd81490890b8f741a2ef0a3c))

-   sewing, knitting, crocheting, and embroidering

-   playing video games

-   being a Notion power-user üòç

-   attending data community events ([I recommend the DSH](https://posit.co/data-science-hangout/))

-   illustrating, painting, and taking photographs

-   watching something delightfully nerdy

-   Tea. Black. Hot... with oat milk üòã
