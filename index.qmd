## Hi there! ![](assets/img/JR-logo.svg){.img-va-bottom fig-alt="cat with tail shaped as the letter J next to last name initial R" width="100"}

Thanks for visiting my website -- I'm happy you're here!

I work as a data scientist for the [Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences](https://agr.wa.gov/agscience) section within the Washington State Department of Agriculture. I have a background in natural sciences (BS in Biology, BA in Environmental Studies, and MS in Land Resources & Environmental Sciences). My R programming skills were self/community taught in an effort to improve efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility in data analyses and visualizations.

The core values I live by are **kindness**, **authenticity**, **sustainability**, and **inclusivity**. I feel particularly fulfilled working in the environmental data science space and meeting so many amazing folks in the R and open-source community.

Persuaded by several folks who had positive reactions to my [cat & code themed t-shirts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jadeynryan_rstats-positconf2023-activity-7108591736444112896-o1SR) I made as conversation starters for `posit::conf(2023)`, I started a small business! I am excited to tap into my creativity and combine some of my favorite things in designs that embody cats, programming, and data science. Coming soon: check out my Etsy shop [**the coding cats**](shop.qmd)!

Professionally, I am happiest automating tedious tasks and developing data driven decision-support tools. 

Personally, I am happiest hanging out with my husband and three snowshoe siamese cats, trying new foods, and playing in the beautiful outdoors.
