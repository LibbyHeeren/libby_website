## Hi there! ![](assets/JR-logo.svg){.img-va-bottom fig-alt="cat with tail shaped as the letter J next to last name initial R" width="100"}

Thanks for visiting my website -- I'm happy you're here!

I started a small business to tap into my creativity and combine two of my favorite things: cats and code. I create designs that embody the general theme of cats, programming, and data science. Check out my Etsy shop [**the coding cats**](shop.qmd)!

In my day job, I work as a data scientist for the [Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences](https://agr.wa.gov/agscience) section within the Washington State Department of Agriculture. I have a background in natural sciences (BS in Biology, BA in Environmental Studies, and MS in Land Resources & Environmental Sciences). My R programming skills were self/community taught in an effort to improve efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility in data analyses and visualizations.

The core values I live by are **kindness**, **authenticity**, **sustainability**, and **inclusivity**. I feel particularly fulfilled working in the environmental data science space and meeting so many amazing folks in the R and open-source community.

I am happiest when hanging out with my husband and three snowshoe siamese cats, trying new foods, playing in the beautiful outdoors, automating tedious tasks, and developing data driven decision-support tools.
