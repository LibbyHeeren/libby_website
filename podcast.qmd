Data science is not one thing. The methods and models that get the most airtime rarely represent the reality of day-to-day data work for the majority of people, and that can lead to the average data human feeling pretty inadequate by comparison.  

I found myself wanting to talk candidly with other data professionals and students so that I could develop a healthier, more realistic perspective of my own journey. And once I did that, I thought… why not share that with the world? 

Turns out, we all have a lot of struggles, fears, aspirations, and questions in common, we just don’t put it out in the world because that feels vulnerable. So, let’s share our stories.
